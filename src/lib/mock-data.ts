    body: `Analysis complete. Here's my recommendation:

RECOMMENDATION: XPO Logistics ($2,773)

Why XPO wins:
1. Best value (2nd lowest price, high reliability)
2. 96% OTIF score (excellent)
3. Delivers May 22 (1 day early)
4. Professional carrier with good track record

Comparison:
- XPO: $2,773 | 96% OTIF | 2 days ‚≠ê BEST VALUE
- Old Dominion: $2,900 | 95% OTIF | 2 days
- FedEx: $3,167 | 97% OTIF | 2 days (premium)
- ABC: $2,200 | 78% OTIF | 3-4 days ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKY

Risk Analysis:
ABC saves $573 but has 22% failure rate. With $45k cargo value, expected penalty cost is $297. Real cost difference is only $276, but with much higher customer satisfaction risk.

Reply "BOOK XPO" to proceed.
